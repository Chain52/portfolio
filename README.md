# Colin Hain Portfolio

I am Colin Hain, a full-stack JavaScript developer. This repo contains the main code used throughout my portfolio website. The front-end is built using React 16 and styled using styled-components. The back-end is built using node.js LTS (Express.js framework) and planned AWS services. It is designed with microservices in mind.

## Future Plans

The high-level plans for this project are:
- Finish the first version of the frontend of the website
- Host it through AWS.
- Update my old projects to AWS lambda to be accessible through the site.

## Upcoming Projects

- Conway's Game of Life mapped over a globe using Uber's H3 geospacial indexing.
  - May include game rule change where a cell will die in water.
- A basic banking portal with transfers between accounts.
- A computer science quiz
- Many more...
