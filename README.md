# Colin Hain Portfolio

I am Colin Hain, a full-stack JavaScript developer. This repo contains the main code used throughout my portfolio website. The front-end is built using React 16 and styled using styled-components. The back-end is built using node.js LTS (Express.js framework) and many AWS services. It does follow a microservice approach; as you can see each folder is initialized as it's own npm project.

## Future Plans

The future plans for this project are to first finish the frontend of the website and then to host it through AWS. After I have the site live, I will spend my time updating my old projects to AWS lambda to be accessible through the site.

## Upcoming Projects

- Conway's Game of Life mapped over a globe using Uber's H3 geospacial indexing.
  - May include game rule change where a cell will die in water.
- A basic banking portal with transfers between accounts.
- A computer science quiz

### Disclaimer

I do know this is not the correct use of the README but I do not expect anyone to see this README until I have a more complete website and then this will be updated accordingly.
